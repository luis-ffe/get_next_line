## get_next_line Goals:

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.
Not only that but also how to open and read files in c.

## To do:
Good practices in programming, comments on my functions code to explain in detail their functionality.
